In Death Comes, you and your fellow survivors are thrust into the heart of a relentless zombie apocalypse. 
As the world crumbles around you, survival hinges on your ability to scavenge for resources, fortify your haven, 
and fend off the ever-growing zombie hordes. But it’s not just the undead you need to worry about—hunger, disease, 
and infection lurk in every shadow. Each player controls a unique character, each with their own strengths and abilities. 
The clock is ticking, with every turn bringing new threats and challenges. Random events force tough decisions as you explore 
the desolate landscape in search of the precious fuel needed to escape. Will you work together to survive, or will desperation 
and fear tear your group apart? Death Comes combines intense resource management with strategic combat, offering a thrilling 
blend of cooperation and competition. With an innovative time-scale turn tracker and order system, every decision counts in 
this high-stakes game of survival. Can you outlast the apocalypse, or will death come for you?
